# Work Day Scheduler

Created a work day scheduler to help organize your day. This project allowed me to practice using Jquery's library, third party API integration and other JavaScript skills.

# Criteria met

- When planner is opened the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- Time blocks are presented with time blocks of standard business hours
- Time blocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future
- When I click on a time block I can enter and event
- When I click on a save button that event is saved in the time block
- Upon page refresh saved events persist
